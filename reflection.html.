<p> How I got scratch to draw a square was by activating it with the green flag. I used the pen down tool to visually see it and kept having scratch turn 90 degrees four times to the right after a certain amount of steps along with one second waits. 
For my next sprite I chose an arrow and used the pen down tool again to have the sprite follow the direction my mouse was in to draw the square.
I also learned how to draw a triangle on scratch as well, and I believe it was the hardest. But thaks to the instructors and my peers they helped me a lot. </p>

So today we came up with a class deifinition of what a robot is and it ranged a lot. We said that a robot has a power source, a purpose, sensory input, and operations.
Honestly, I'm not so excited since I've heard the idea of robots taking over the human race, but they can only do that when programed, I'm still not a fan of automated cars.
I liked how during the trial and error part of working in groups with the circuits was that we tried over and over and didn't give up until it worked. xD poor Nataly and the wheel, she wanted it to work so bad.
