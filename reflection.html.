<p> How I got scratch to draw a square was by activating it with the green flag. I used the pen down tool to visually see it and kept having scratch turn 90 degrees four times to the right after a certain amount of steps along with one second waits. 
For my next sprite I chose an arrow and used the pen down tool again to have the sprite follow the direction my mouse was in to draw the square.
I also learned how to draw a triangle on scratch as well, and I believe it was the hardest. But thaks to the instructors and my peers they helped me a lot. </p>
