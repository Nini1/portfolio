<p> How I got scratch to draw a square was by activating it with the green flag. I used the pen down tool to visually see it and kept having scratch turn 90 degrees four times to the right after a certain amount of steps along with one second waits. 
For my next sprite I chose an arrow and used the pen down tool again to have the sprite follow the direction my mouse was in to draw the square.
I also learned how to draw a triangle on scratch as well, and I believe it was the hardest. But thaks to the instructors and my peers they helped me a lot. </p>

	<p> So far based on what I've learned, Python and Scratch are differnt coding applications based on the following:
	Scratch has code blocks already created for users and is like a beginning type of program. Python is where you have to
	create the code all by yourself and set and define variables.
	
	Debugging the program was a bit difficult because it mostly consisted of trial and error, (many errors) but I managed. </p>

<h2> June 30, 2017 </h2>
	<p> A list is one of the many tools used in programs, such as python.
	I believe that lists are helpful because they can be used to store several amounts of data and it can store, add, or delete elements.
	I think that the type of groups I've worked with best is the ones that I'm on the same page with. 
	I feel that these groups are better because we all sort of fall on the same page of how well or not we understand people.
	Also working with different people because everyone learns and teaches in different ways. </p>

<p> So today we came up with a class deifinition of what a robot is and it ranged a lot. We said that a robot has a power source, a purpose, sensory input, and operations.
Honestly, I'm not so excited since I've heard the idea of robots taking over the human race, but they can only do that when programed, I'm still not a fan of automated cars.
I liked how during the trial and error part of working in groups with the circuits was that we tried over and over and didn't give up until it worked.(xD poor Nataly and the wheel, she wanted it to work so bad).

<p> Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard both work with robots.
They both work to see how they interract with people and their surroundings, teaching them as they ago to adapt and learn to complete task for the world.

<p> One new thing that I learned about the internet was that the World Wide Web (www) is in fact not the internet and much more.
I guess LaTeX would be considered a programing or mark up language because ___________________

<p> I learned how to code the movement of a robot. I learned how a servo and piezo work when connected to a circuit in order to get the robot to move.
Also Kate really helped me and my group when understanding the code for the arduino.
My favorite part was presentations, because it was fun watching the robots move to each of the songs that the groups had chosen and overal I liked the project.
Well when we created our website our servos were already inputed into the pins 13 and 12, so depending on their circuit boards they would neeed a power source in order to gain a good position for their servos.
Also they would need to know the angle of degree that their bots turn, stop, and move backwards or forwards. </p>

Today I learned about more differnet components used in a circuit, like whisker wires, infrared LED's and capacitors.
My group did a good job completing the whisker wired robot because we had two people who really understood how to good, but I wish that they would've made sure everyone in the group caught up and understood what was going on.

<p> So I searxhed up my name and the only thing available about my is whatever I have associated with school. 
So a ThingLiink I made in 8th grade. And some of my stuff from an app. I think that stuff is avaliable because my school has public and probably unsercured sites.
You can't really protect information very much online because anyone can access it. All data can be hacked and traced so try best not to put your information on the internet.
Latanya Sweeny and Shafi Goldwasser, both do code in order to solve problems and make a change.

<h2> July 18, 2017 </h2>
<p> I guesss the most interesting thing about the data today was how dataframes, lists, and dictionaries all had something in common but diffrenciated a lot as well.
They could all be used when programming.
I think computers are good at keeping data because they all have libraries. 
They all have these files and folders where you can just organizes and store everything which is a very useful feature to have. </p>

I am most proud of:
I thought that bubble sort was interesting because I thought how is bubble sort

<p> One skill that I can build to be a more effective leader is probably by building my communication skills.
To strengthen this skill I can try gain contact information and start speaking up more.
I can check if I'm improving by telling how much I am contributing throughout the day.
Our team is dividing the work by pages and by new elements we are incorporating into our pages.
We chose to split the work because we all want to share the coding equally with each other and for the new elements, we all want to learn something knew and learn that new skill during our project.
I am respondible for our random results page in our project, and I am to figure out how to opporate buttons and validating checkboxes.
I will make sure I complete these tasks by setting deadlines and completing my research in and outside of class. </p>
