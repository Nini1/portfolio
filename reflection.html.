<p> How I got scratch to draw a square was by activating it with the green flag. I used the pen down tool to visually see it and kept having scratch turn 90 degrees four times to the right after a certain amount of steps along with one second waits. 
For my next sprite I chose an arrow and used the pen down tool again to have the sprite follow the direction my mouse was in to draw the square.
I also learned how to draw a triangle on scratch as well, and I believe it was the hardest. But thaks to the instructors and my peers they helped me a lot. </p>

	<p> So far based on what I've learned, Python and Scratch are differnt coding applications based on the following:
	Scratch has code blocks already created for users and is like a beginning type of program. Python is where you have to
	create the code all by yourself and set and define variables.
	
	Debugging the program was a bit difficult because it mostly consisted of trial and error, (many errors) but I managed. </p>

	<p> A list is one of the many tools used in programs, such as python.
	I believe that lists are helpful because they can be used to store several amounts of data and it can store, add, or delete elements.
	I think that the type of groups I've worked with best is the ones that I'm on the same page with. 
	I feel that these groups are better because we all sort of fall on the same page of how well or not we understand people.
	Also working with different people because everyone learns and teaches in different ways. </p>

<p> So today we came up with a class deifinition of what a robot is and it ranged a lot. We said that a robot has a power source, a purpose, sensory input, and operations.
Honestly, I'm not so excited since I've heard the idea of robots taking over the human race, but they can only do that when programed, I'm still not a fan of automated cars.
I liked how during the trial and error part of working in groups with the circuits was that we tried over and over and didn't give up until it worked.(xD poor Nataly and the wheel, she wanted it to work so bad).

<p> Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard both work with robots.
They both work to see how they interract with people and their surroundings, teaching them as they ago to adapt and learn to complete task for the world.

<p> One new thing that I learned about the internet was that the World Wide Web (www) is in fact not the internet and much more.
I guess LaTeX would be considered a programing or mark up language because ___________________
